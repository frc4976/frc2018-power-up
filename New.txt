ELEVATOR LOGIC - V3

IMPORTANT - ALL PRESETS ARE AND WILL BE CALIBRATED WITH THE ELEVATOR AT BOTTOM AND ARM AT MAX AS ZERO 

ALL LIMIT SWITCHES MUST WORK ALL THE TIME, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Even if the arm or elevator were zeroed at the wrong place and presets malfunction,
limit switches must always work!! - Caveat - If the switches happen to break, they must fail UNSAFE. They must not restrict motion if failed.

Slow band when moving up into max range, and down into ground range, not vice versa for either. //done

Enable elevator presets that move upwards if min switch is pressed, and presets that move down if max is, not vice versa for either. //done

Enable linkarm presets that move upwards if min switch is pressed, and presets that move down if max is, not vice versa for either. //done

Zero elevator at min switch, arm at max. //done

If elevator manual override, stop both elevator and arm. If arm override, just stop arm. //done

Add interlock between arm and elevator. Prevent elevator from moving down while arm is in a position that would be dangerous. 
Likewise, prevent the arm from moving down into the bot. The position this will be at is determined by the height of the elevator.
Adjust arm soft and hard stop zones accordingly.


TO BE TESTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ELEVATOR
- Added soft zone upon approaching preset. Does it work? If so, is it too fast? Slow? Tune.
- Added parameter based preset method. Does it work? Feed various values. See if behaviour is exactly the same. If so, REMOVE ALL OTHER PRESET METHODS
and clean up code oodles.
- Revamped flag system. Does it work? Should enable upward presets to be used while the bottom limit switch is pressed, and vice versa, but while still stopping
at the appropriate limit.
- Added climb/down commands on shoulder buttons. Test.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LINK-ARM
- Added downward speed adjustment. Does it work? Is it too fast? Slow? Tune.
- - Revamped flag system. Does it work? Should enable upward presets to be used while the bottom limit switch is pressed, and vice versa, but while still stopping
at the appropriate limit.
- - Added parameter based preset method. Does it work? Feed various values. See if behaviour is exactly the same. If so, REMOVE ALL OTHER PRESET METHODS
